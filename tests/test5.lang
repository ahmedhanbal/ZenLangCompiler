## test5.zl  —  Comment Processing
## Tests single-line and block comments in various positions

## This is a single-line comment at the top of the file

#* 
   This is a block comment at the top.
   It spans multiple lines.
   The scanner should skip all of this.
*#

start

    ## Inline comment after a statement
    declare X = 42    ## X holds the answer

    ## Comment between declarations
    declare Y = 100

    #* Block comment between statements
       Y is used below *#

    declare Z = X + Y   ## Z = 142

    ## Comments inside a loop
    loop (X > 0)
        ## Decrement X each iteration
        X--    ## X decreases by 1
        #* 
           This block comment is inside the loop.
           It should be completely ignored.
        *#
        condition (X == 20)
            break   ## exit when X reaches 20
        finish
    finish

    ## Comment before output
    output "Z = ", Z   ## print Z

    #* 
       Multi-line block comment before finish.
       Contains keywords like start finish loop
       that should NOT be tokenised because they are inside a comment.
       Also contains operators: + - * / == != <= >=
       And identifiers: Alpha Beta Gamma
    *#

    ## Single-line comment with special characters: @$#%^&*()
    ## Another comment: "strings inside comments are ignored"
    ## Nested ## hashes inside a line comment

    declare Result = Z * 2   ## final result

    output Result

finish   ## end of main block

## Final comment at end of file
## The scanner should have processed all comments correctly
